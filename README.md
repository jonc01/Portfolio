<!-- The original prototype was created for a game jam with the submission requiring a score system and leaderboard. Since I didn't have enough time to design full stages, I opted for a survival/endless game mode.  -->

Complete redesign of my the first 2D Roguelike project, I wanted to implement the Level Generation system I prototyped before. 
The Augment system ended up being more complicated than I anticipated, but was very rewarding when completed.

## Level Generation Prototype

This prototype was put together in a few days, it was a small project to explore level generation with premade rooms. 
Rooms would be given a door when connected to another room, and a wall otherwise. Premade rooms would be randomly assigned to each space with parameters determining how many of each room would be assigned in the level.
Room connections would be determined with a raycast to check for collisions.
This would all run in real time as the game was loaded, providing a different layout each time.

My first completed project demo, I learned a lot about game design and development within Unity itself while working on this project.
