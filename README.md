The original prototype was created for a game jam with the submission requiring a score system and leaderboard. Since I didn't have enough time to design full stages, I opted for a survival/endless game mode.
I wanted to create a game based on Vampire Survivors, but with a team of heroes instead of weapons. 

Optimizing the game to handle a large number of enemies at once proved to be the biggest challenge, it taught me a lot about utilizing the Unity Profiler to diagnose performance issues. 
Writing the AI logic for the friendly units was a challenge, but I'm happy with the result.

Complete redesign of my the first 2D Roguelike project, I wanted to implement the Level Generation system I prototyped before and make a more complete designed game.

Each enemy is designed to fill a different role and teach the player different mechanics, and the Boss combines all of these mechanics as a final test for the Player. I never paid much attention to enemy design in roguelike games until designing these enemies. 
Enemy design took some inspiration from Hades and Dead Cells, in which the Player would have to change their approach based on the combination of enemies in each area. Of course, most of this can be ignored once the Player gets more powerful items.

The Augment system ended up being more complicated than I anticipated, but I had fun coding the conditional augment effects. Initially I wanted to keep augments less powerful to keep the emphasis on the Player's ability, but I didn't want to inhibit the 'overpowered' moment that most roguelike/lite games provide.

## Level Generation Prototype

This prototype was put together in a few days, it was a small project to explore level generation with premade rooms. 

Rooms would be given a door when connected to another room, and a wall otherwise. Premade rooms would be randomly assigned to each space with parameters determining how many of each room would be assigned in the level.
Room connections would be determined with a raycast to check for collisions.
This would all run in real time as the game was loaded, providing a different layout each time.

My first completed project demo, I learned a lot about game design and development within Unity itself while working on this project. 
This project taught me a lot about scope creep, the genre and design changed many times as I realized how much I didn't know about game development. 
While I did make a lot of mistakes and the demo is a bit rough, everything I've learned from working on this project I've been able to apply to future projects.
